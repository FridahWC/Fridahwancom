        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a data science enthusiast with a strong foundation of statistical modelling, data analysis and machine learning concepts. I am passionate about solving problems using data by leveraging my skills in python and My SQL programming languages and data visualization tools such as tableau and Matplotlib. </p>
        <p>Currently, I am learning software development and I am passionate about improving my skills through small, focused projects.</p>
        <h2>What drives me</h2>
        <p>I am a critical thinker, always trying to get to the root of things and looking for solutions to every problem. What drives me is the desire to make the world a better place. One of the possible ways is finding solutions to the problems we are facing. By using data you get to formulate a hypothesis that defines the analytical approach to solve the problem. Data is then wrangled, transformed and visualized using programming tools such as python to get insights and then come up with actionable solutions.</p>
